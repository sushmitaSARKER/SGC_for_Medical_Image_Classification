## Can Score-based Generative Modeling Effectively Handle Medical Image Classification?

Discriminative models often face a trade-off between data likelihood and classification accuracy. In this study, we investigate the use of score-based generative models as classifiers for medical images, with a focus on mammographic images. By leveraging their ability to capture underlying data distributions in closely related classes and achieve competitive likelihood values, we aim to address the limitations of discriminative models and highlight their potential for improved performance.
